## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - JS Framework, using React.js

### What I learned

Got familiar with @container rule, which was necessary to make sure component styles changed in according to it's own width instead of the viewport width.

### Continued development

In the next project that features toggle-able mobile navigation menus, I will learn to apply animations to it effectively.
